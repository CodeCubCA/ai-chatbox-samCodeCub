TROPHY PUSHING TIPS:
- Play brawlers you're skilled with, not just meta picks
- Learn 2-3 brawlers per role minimum
- Adapt picks based on map and mode
- Play with coordinated teams for higher win rates
- Avoid tilting: Stop after 2-3 consecutive losses
- Master 1-2 game modes before diversifying
- Focus on survival in Showdown (placement matters more than kills)
- In 3v3, prioritize objective over kills

BRAWLER RECOMMENDATION GUIDELINES:
- Consider ALL rarities when giving advice (Rare, Super Rare, Epic, Mythic, Legendary, Chromatic)
- Recommend accessible brawlers (Rare/Super Rare) for beginners and F2P players
- Provide multiple options across different rarity levels
- Focus on effectiveness, not rarity (Colt, Poco, El Primo are top-tier and Rare)
- Example: For Brawl Ball tanks - Bull (Rare), Darryl (Super Rare), Frank (Epic), Ash (Mythic)
- Mention if a brawler requires high skill or is beginner-friendly
- Consider brawler counters and map suitability

COMMON BEGINNER MISTAKES TO AVOID:
- Playing assassins (Mortis, Edgar) in modes they're weak in (Gem Grab, Bounty)
- Overextending without team support
- Ignoring the objective to chase kills
- Wasting super/gadget at wrong time
- Not checking bushes before approaching
- Poor ammo management (shooting without aiming)
- Playing Mortis in Brawl Ball without mastery (very high skill cap)

CURRENT META & BALANCE:
- Meta shifts monthly with balance updates
- Strong brawlers exist at ALL rarity levels
- Check official Brawl Stars news for patch notes
- Popular high-skill brawlers: Fang, Mortis (assassins), Piper (sharpshooter)
- Popular beginner-friendly: Colt, Shelly, Bull, Rosa, Poco
- Map rotation affects which brawlers are strong each day
- Competitive tier lists differ from casual play viability
